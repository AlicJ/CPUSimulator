- `Done` ~~change naming of `level` inside `InstructionBlockController` `programCounter` or something~~
- `Done` ~~chagne naming of `stage` inside `InstructionBlockController` to `level`~~
- `Done` ~~compare and branch~~
- `Done` ~~memory block functionality and related instructions~~
- UI that fits different iPads

From Dr. Anand
--
- most devices are ipad mini
- `Done` ~~load immediate should be on top of the number in instruction block~~
- `Done` ~~for branch, have the user to scroll the instruction to the right one, and have a hint button to tell them more information.~~
- `Done` ~~for compare, have another register like holder to hold the result, and do the operation in ALU block~~
- drag operations from the instruction block/ or have it rotate in the operation block
- animations of numbers from instruction block to the register block so the user can understand that the numbers are going through the circuits as binaries
- easter egg, show the number in register bit by bit
- have the entire app a background of a circuit board in light shade, and have the ALU, Instruction, Memory, and Register block as chips, with pins sticking out mapping to corresponding pins of each other.
