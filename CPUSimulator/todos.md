- `Done` ~~change naming of `level` inside `InstructionBlockController` `programCounter` or something~~
- `Done` ~~chagne naming of `stage` inside `InstructionBlockController` to `level`~~

- `Done` ~~compare and branch~~
- memory block functionality and related instructions
- UI that fits different iPads

From Dr. Anand
--
- load immediate should be on top of the number in instruction block
- operations should be dragged from instruction blocks
- drag operations from the instruction block/ or have it rotate in the operation block
animations of numbers from instruction block to the register block so the user can understand that the numbers are going through the circuits as binaries
- for branch, have the user to scroll the instruction to the right one, and have a hint button to tell them more information.
- for compare, have another register like holder to hold the result, and do the operation in ALU block
- easter egg, show the number in register bit by bit
- most devices are ipad mini

- have the entire app a background of a circuit board in light shade, and have the ALU, Instruction, Memory, and Register block as chips, with pins sticking out mapping to corresponding pins of each other.
